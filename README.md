# Hinoki

A [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) implementation for BrightScript.

Users are generally expected to interact with Hinoki through a client package. Currently client implementations are available for

* Atom - [Atom IDE Brightscript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-brightscript)

There are convenience scripts located in the `package.json` to help get you started. The recommended environment
